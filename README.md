## MizzAI, a simple HTML, CSS, JS AI chatbot.

This was made for funsies, and yes you can use it freely as long as you mention me, i would LOVE to see what you come with ><!!.

You can use it for roleplaying, or for extra more things.
This uses the FREE API key of my Google Developer account, so it is limited to 20~
API requests per day until i can afford an unlimited plan (or smth).
